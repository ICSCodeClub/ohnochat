# overview
Thanks for even trying to contribute to OhnoChat.
Using this guide will help you get more chances (despite them already being large enough) for your pr to get merged.
By using this it will let the managing developers get more time to be able to look over pr's

We look forward to all contributions, especially big changes.

# Ground Rules
1. Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
2. In order for your pr to be merged, it needs to pass the travis ci tests, without modifing the .travis.yml or the .pom.xml (UNLESS NEEDED, JUST SAY SO). Pr's that do not pass checks, will be closed

# Getting started

#### For beginners
resources that beginners can use.
**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
https://www.firsttimersonly.com/


No need to sign any agreement.
For anything that is bigger than a couple lines of code fix, 
1. Fork, 
2. Do the changes in your fork,
### IMPORTANT
4. Make sure they pass all checks including, codefactor, and travis ci, without editing the .travis.yml or the pom.xml (EXCEPTIONS CAN BE MADE)
3. Create PR and specifying why it should be merged and what it brings to the table

# Security and bugs
#### security
Any security issues should be submitted directly to fastspy@outlook.com In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at fastspy@outlook.com.

#### bugs
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

What version of java are you using?
What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
What did you do?
What did you expect to see?
What did you see instead?
